    <div>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.<br>
    </br> Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. <br>
    </br>It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.<br>
    </br> It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin.<br>
    </br> Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats.<br>
    </br> It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.</div>
